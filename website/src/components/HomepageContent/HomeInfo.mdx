# Package-URL Project

Software ecosystems have evolved into highly interconnected networks of
components, packages, and dependencies. Managing this complexity demands
a robust, uniform mechanism to identify and track software packages (and 
their ersions) across diverse ecosystems and tools. 

The Package-URL project was developed to address this challenge by creating:
- PURL (Package-URL): a standard URL-based syntax to identify software 
packages, independent from their ecosystem or distribution channel, and 
- VERS (VErsion Range Specifier): a standard URI-based syntax to define 
package version ranges and version semantics (algorithm or procedure) to 
interpret a version range notation. 

## PURL
PURL embeds critical software package metadata directly into its structure, 
enabling efficient and accurate package identification at scale. Each PURL
**type** provides a standard way to identify, locate, and provision software 
packages according to the conventions and protocols for a package manager, 
platform, or ecosystem. This standardization ensures interoperability between 
tools and ecosystems, fostering greater collaboration and reducing ambiguity 
in software supply chain management.

Challenges addressed by PURL:

- **Ambiguity in Package Identification:** With diverse naming
conventions across ecosystems, identifying software packages reliably
has historically been a challenge. PURL eliminates this ambiguity by
creating a universal identifier with a predictable structure.
- **Cross-Ecosystem Interoperability:** Developers, organizations, and
tools often work across multiple ecosystems, each with its own package
management systems. PURL harmonizes these differences, enabling
seamless interoperability.
- **Enhanced Traceability and Risk Management:** In an era where supply
chain security is critical, PURL provides the foundation for
identifying and tracing packages to their origins, dependencies, and
potential vulnerabilities.
- **Tooling and Automation:** By standardizing package identification,
PURL simplifies tooling development, automation, and integration for
tasks such as software composition analysis, vulnerability management,
and license compliance.

section of this website for details about:

- How to build, parse or test a PURL
- The current set of registered PURL **types**

PURL was approved by Ecma International as [ECMA-427](https://ecma-tc54.github.io/ECMA-427/)
in December 2025 and is on a fast track to become an ISO standard. 

## VERS
VERS provides a structured notation that defines software package version 
ranges and provides rules to resolve the content of a version range. Each 
VERS scheme provides a standard way to define and resolve a version range for
for a package manager, platform, or ecosystem. The construction and validation 
rules are designed such that a VERS is easy to read and understand by humans 
and straightforward to process by tools, This standardization ensures 
more accurate and consistent analysis of package version dependencies and the 
impact of known vulnerabilities or bugs on a software package. 

Challenges addressed by VERS:

- **Ambiguity of package dependencies:** With diverse version range notations 
across ecosystems, accurately and consistently identifying software package 
dependencies is a long-standing problem. VERS eliminates this ambiguity by 
creating a universal version range notation with a predictable structure.
- **Ambiguity of package versions affected by a vulnerability:** With diverse 
version range notations across ecosystems, accurately and consistently 
identifying software package versions affected by a vulnerability or bug is 
extremely difficult. VERS eliminates this ambiguity by creating a universal 
version range notation with a predictable structure.
- **Tooling and Automation:** By standardizing version range analysis, 
VERS simplifies tooling development, automation, and integration for tasks 
such as software composition analysis and software vulnerability management.

See the [VERS](https://package-url.github.io/www.packageurl.org/docs/vers-spec/vers-spec-introduction) 
section of this website for details about:
- The VERS specification
- How to parse and validate a VERS

VERS will be submitted to Ecma as a new standard in later 2026.

## PURL and VERS
The PURL and VERS specifications are synergistic in several ways including:
- A VERS **version-scheme** can be defined for a PURL **type**.
- You can use the 'vers' **qualifiers** key in a PURL to identify a version
range for a package.

The following section documents Specifications and Tools that have adopted
PURL or VERS or both.
