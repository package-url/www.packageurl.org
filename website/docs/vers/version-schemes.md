# Version schemes

There is a very wide range of software version schemes. For the development of
the VERS specification, we are focused on three types of version schemes:

- Package ecosystem version schemes: Our initial focus is to define VERS
**version-schemes** for packages with a registered [PURL (Package-URL) **type**](https://package-url.github.io/www.packageurl.org/docs/purl/purl-spec-purl-types#registered-purl-types).
- Vulnerability system version range schemes: The focus here is on the
definition of version ranges for major vulnerability databases, such as the
[NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and the [OSV](https://osv.dev/), to identify
which software package or component versions are impacted by a reported
vulnerability.
- Generic version schemes: These version schemes should be reserved for
special cases.

## Package ecosystem version schemes
Most software package ecosystems have a version-scheme. Some variation of
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) is probably the most popular approach to
structure version strings, but it does not provide a way to express version
ranges.

The following table lists versioning schemes for some common registered [PURL
(Package-URL) **types**](https://package-url.github.io/www.packageurl.org/docs/purl/purl-spec-purl-types#registered-purl-types). If there is a registered PURL
**type** for a package ecosystem, the PURL type will also be the name for the
VERS **version-scheme**.

| PURL type | Description   | Reference URL      |
| --------- | --------------| ------------------ |
| alpm   | Arch Linux uses its own simplified notation for its PKGBUILD depends array and uses a modified RPM version comparison. | https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD#Dependencies|
| apk    | Alpine Linux uses comparison operators similar to VERS.              | https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/apk-tools/-/blob/master/src/version.c|
| cargo     | Cargo for Rust uses a version scheme that is similar to "node-semver". |  https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html |
| composer  | Composer for PHP  | https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md |
| cpan      | Perl CPAN defines its own version range notation similar to VERS with two-segment versions. |  https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec#VERSION-NUMBERS <br> https://perlmaven.com/how-to-compare-version-numbers-in-perl-and-for-cpan-modules  |
| dart | The Dart pub versioning scheme is similar to "node-semver". Version resolution uses its own algorithm. | https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning |
| deb       | Debian and Ubuntu use their own notation and are known for their use of "epochs" to disambiguate versions. They both use the comparators: '<<', '<=', '=', '>=' and '>>'| https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html |
| gem       | RubyGems strongly suggests using SemVer for versioning but does not enforce it. As a result some popular packages do not use strict Semver. RubyGems uses their own notation for version ranges which is similar to the "node-semver" notation with some subtle differences. | https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic-versioning |
| golang    | Go modules use SemVer versions with a specific minimum version resolution algorithm.   | https://golang.org/ref/mod#versions|
| hackage | The Haskell Package Versioning Policy provides a notation similar to VERS based on a modified SemVer with extra notations such as star and caret.   | https://pvp.haskell.org/  |
| maven     | Apache Maven uses a [math interval notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)) with brackets. | http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html  |
| nuget     | Nuget uses a [math interval notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)) with brackets. | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/package-versioning#version-ranges |
| npm       | npm uses "node-semver" which is based on SemVer with its own  range notation. Several other package types use "node-semver"-like ranges, but most of these related version schemes do not implement "node-semver". | https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges |
| pypi      | Python uses its own version and version range notation with notable peculiarities for how pre-release and post-release suffixes are used. | https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/   |
| rpm       | RPM distros use their own range notation and they use "epochs" like Debian. | https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/dependencies.html |

## Vulnerability database version schemes

### CPE/NVD version schemes

- Version 5 of the CVE JSON data format defines version ranges with a
  **starting version**, a **versionType**, and an upper limit for the
  version range as 'lessThan' or 'lessThanOrEqual'; or as an enumeration
  of versions. The **versionType** is defined as "The version numbering
  system used   for specifying the range. This defines the exact semantics
  of the comparison (less-than) operation on versions, which is required
  to understand the range itself".
    A **versionType** resembles closely the Package-URL package **type**.
  See: https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/CVE_JSON_5.0.schema#L303

- The NVD defines CPE ranges as lists of version start and end versions
  either including or excluding the start or end version. NVD also provides
  an enumeration of the available ranges as a daily feed.
  See: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds#cpeMatch

### OSV version scheme
- The OSSF OSV schema defines vulnerable ranges with version events using
  "introduced", "fixed" and "limit" fields and an optional enumeration of all
  versions in these ranges, except for "semver"-based versions. A range may be
  ecosystem-specific based on a provided package "ecosystem" value
  that resembles the Package-URL package "type". See: https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/

## Generic version schemes

These are generic schemes, to be used sparingly for special cases:

- **all**: a generic versioning scheme for a range containing all
versions. 'vers:all/*' is the only valid VERS form for this scheme.
- **datetime**: a generic scheme that uses a timestamp for comparison.
The timestamp must adhere to RFC3339, section 5.6. See
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6.
- **generic**: a generic version comparison algorithm (which will be
specified later, likely based on a split on any wholly alpha or
 wholly numeric segments and dealing with digit and string
 comparisons, similar to libversion).
- **intdot**: a generic versioning scheme that allows version
components to be specified as integers separated by dots, e.g.
'10.234.5.12'. Versions specified in this scheme consist of ASCII
digits only, formatted with only non-negative integers, and ignoring
leading zeros. Interpretation of the version should stop at the
first character that is not a digit or a dot.
- **lexicographic**: a generic versioning scheme that compares
versions based on lexicographic order, interpreted as UTF-8. Strings
should be compared bytewise as unsigned bytes without normalization.
UTF-8 encoding is defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3629.
- **none**: a generic versioning scheme for a range containing no
versions. 'vers:none/*' is the only valid VERS form for this scheme.
- **semver**: a generic scheme that uses the same syntax as SemVer.
It follows the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format and is defined in the
Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0. See
https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html.

## Version comparison conventions

The way two versions are compared as equal, less than or greater than is
closely related to version schemes.

- Each package ecosystem may have evolved its own specific version
  string conventions, semantics and comparison procedure. For instance,
  "semver" is a prominent specification in this domain but it is just
  one of the many ways to structure a version string.
- Debian, RPM, PyPI, RubyGems, and Composer have their own subtly
  different approaches to determine how two versions are compared
  as equal, greater than or less than.
