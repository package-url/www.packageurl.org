# Introduction

There is no universal notation for software package version ranges and
there is no universal way to compare two versions of a package even though the concepts in many version range notations are similar. Each package type or ecosystem may define its own version range notation and version comparison semantics for dependencies.

For security advisories, the lack of a portable and compact notation for vulnerable package version ranges means that these ranges may be ambiguous
or hard to compute and may be replaced by complete enumerations of
all impacted versions. Expressing and resolving a version range is often a complex and error prone task because of the ambiguity and the use of enumerations of impacted versions is an appproach that may require frequent updates. A version range is a necessary, compact, and practical way to reference multiple versions rather than listing all versions.

VErsion Range Specifier (VERS) introduces a standard URI-based syntax to define package version ranges and the semantics (algorithm or procedure) to interpret each version range notation. This standardization provides ensures more accurate and consistent analysis of package version dependencies and the impact of known vulnerabilities or bugs on a package. VERS was developed in concert with the Package-URL (PURL) specification standardized with [ECMA-427](https://ecma-tc54.github.io/ECMA-427/).

Challenges addressed by VERS:
- **Ambiguity of package dependencies**: With diverse version range notations across ecosystems, accurately and consistently identifying software package dependencies is a long-standing problem. VERS eliminates this ambiguity by creating a universal version range notation with a predictable structure.
- **Ambiguity of package versions affected by a vulnerability**: With diverse version range notations across ecosystems, accurately and consistently identifying software package versions affected by a vulnerability or bug is
extremely difficult. VERS eliminates this ambiguity by creating a universal version range notation with a predictable structure.
- **Tooling and Automation**: By standardizing version range analysis, VERS simplifies tooling development, automation, and integration for tasks such as software composition analysis and software vulnerability management.

As software supply chain security becomes a global priority, formalizing VERS
as an international standard supports its adoption and consistent implementation. Standardization under Ecma International Technical Committee
54 (TC54) positions VERS as a foundational building block for secure, transparent, and efficient software ecosystems worldwide.

By enabling a universally recognized and implementable specification, VERS aligns with global efforts to improve the security, reliability, and accountability of software supply chains. Its adoption ensures that organizations and developers can rely on a common way to specify and interpret
package version ranges for managing package dependency resolution and software
vulnerability analysis and mitigation.
