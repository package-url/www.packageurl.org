## Upcoming Events

### FOSDEM 2026

**FOSDEM**, one of the largest gatherings of Free and Open Source Software 
developers in the world. The 2026 conference will be held on January 31 and 
February 1 in Brussels, Belgium. 

We expect PURL and VERS to be a major part of many discussions, but there are
also two devroom talks about PURL:

- On Saturday, January 31, Philippe Ombredanne, the original creator of PURL,
will trace the history of PURL from its debut at FOSDEM 2018 to its recent
recognition as the [ECMA-427 standard](https://ecma-tc54.github.io/ECMA-427/).
   - Track: Package Management
   - Title: PURL: From FOSDEM 2018 to international standard
   - More information at: https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/P8AAT3-purl/

- On Sunday, February 1, Philippe Ombredanne and Steve Springett, Chair of the 
OWASP Global Board of Directors and leader of CycloneDX, will explain how and
why PURL is the essential software identifier for any SBOM use case.
   - Track: SBOMS and supply chains
   - Title: Forget SBOMs, use PURLs
   - More information at: https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DRGX73-purl/
